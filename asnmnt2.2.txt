Difference Between Compiler and Interpreter

 Compiler is a translator.
 It converts the source code (source program) to object code(object program).
 It coverts high level language to machine level language.
 Compiler is a source code that checks all errors found in a program.
 The compiler takes .javafile and compiles it into a .classfile
 It generates the error message only after scanning the whole program, so debugging is comparatively hard.
 Memory Requirement is more.
 Example : C Compiler	


 An interpreter is a program that reads in as input a source program
 And it  is a line by line execution of a program
 The jvm takes  .classfile and interuptes it.
 After compiling a program while execution it checks the errors in a byte code.
 Continues translating the program until the first error is met in which case it stops,so debugging is easy.
 Memory Requirement is Less.
 Example : BASIC
